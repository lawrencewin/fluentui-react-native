# @fluentui-react-native/synthetic-focus-manager

This is an experimental framework package that allows a component to render "fake focus".

This is useful when implementing a component, such as a combobox, where the user needs to be able to keyboard through the UI while native focus remains locked to a specific element.

Current components supported:

- Button
- TabList
